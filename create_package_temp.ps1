# RustyBot v1.5.0 - Twitch Giveaway Bot

## üöÄ Quick Start

### First Time Setup
1. **Double-click RustyBot.vbs** - Launches RustyBot
2. A welcome dialog will appear asking for **your Twitch channel name**
3. Enter your channel name (e.g., "yourchannelname")
4. Click OK - You're done!

### Every Time After
**Double-click RustyBot.vbs** - Bot automatically connects to your channel!

OR

**Double-click RustyBot.bat** - Alternative launcher (shows console briefly)

**Note**: After first setup, the bot remembers your channel forever!

## üìÅ Folder Structure

### Root Folder (What you see)
- **RustyBot.vbs** - Main launcher (recommended - silent launch)
- **RustyBot.bat** - Alternative launcher (shows console briefly)
- **config.json** - Your settings (edit here)
- **secure.env** - Encrypted bot credentials (included, don't edit!)
- **README.txt** - This file
- **app/** - Application files (all the messy stuff is here!)

### App Folder (Don't touch unless needed)
The `app` folder contains:
- RustyBot.exe - The actual application
- All Python libraries and dependencies
- All DLL files (277 files!)
- assets/, sounds/, Fonts/ folders

**üí° Tip**: You don't need to go into the app folder. Just use the launchers in the root!

## üîê Security

**Your bot token is encrypted!**

The `secure.env` file contains encrypted Twitch credentials:
- ‚úÖ Bot token is encrypted and protected
- ‚úÖ Can't be easily extracted or read
- ‚úÖ Works automatically without configuration
- ‚úÖ No need for users to get their own bot token

**Users don't need their own credentials** - the bot is already configured!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### First-Run Setup (Automatic!)
On first launch, you'll be asked for **your Twitch channel name**.
- Just enter your channel (e.g., "yourchannelname")
- No need for a bot token or credentials!
- The bot is pre-configured and ready to go

### To Change Your Channel Later
1. Open RustyBot
2. Click the Options button (‚öôÔ∏è icon)
3. Update "Your Twitch Channel"
4. Click Save
5. Restart the bot

### Other Settings
**To change app settings:**
1. Edit config.json in the root folder
2. **DO NOT edit secure.env** - it contains encrypted credentials
3. Restart RustyBot

The app will automatically read your settings from the root folder!

**Note**: The bot uses pre-configured credentials. You don't need your own Twitch bot token!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Antivirus Warning
Some antivirus software may flag this application. **This is a false positive!**

The application is completely safe:
- ‚úÖ Open source: https://github.com/nexis84/Rusty-Client
- ‚úÖ Built with Nuitka (Python compiler)
- ‚úÖ No malicious code

**If Windows Defender blocks it:**
1. Click "More info" ‚Üí "Run anyway"
2. Or add the folder to Windows Defender exclusions:
   - Open Windows Security
   - Virus & threat protection ‚Üí Manage settings
   - Exclusions ‚Üí Add or remove exclusions
   - Add this folder

### Keep Files Together
**DO NOT** move files out of their folders!
- Keep the `app` folder with the root folder
- Don't separate RustyBot.exe from its DLL files
- Extract the entire ZIP before running

## üîÑ Updates

The app checks for updates automatically on startup.
When a new version is available, you'll see a notification.
Click "Download & Install" to update automatically!

## üìù Settings Files

Edit these files in the ROOT folder (not in app folder):

- **config.json** - Application settings
  - Sound volumes
  - Animation speeds
  - UI colors
  
- **secure.env** - Encrypted bot credentials (DO NOT EDIT!)
  - Bot token is encrypted
  - Pre-configured for you
  - No changes needed!

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Application won't start"
- Make sure you extracted ALL files from the ZIP
- Don't move files between folders
- Try running as Administrator
- Use RustyBot.vbs instead of RustyBot.bat

### "Can't find config.json"
- Make sure config.json is in the ROOT folder (same level as the launchers)
- Don't move or rename it

### "Missing DLL" Error
- Make sure the `app` folder is present and hasn't been moved
- Re-extract the ZIP file if something is missing

### "No sound"
- Check config.json in root folder
- Verify your system volume isn't muted

### "Can't connect to Twitch"
- Edit .env in root folder
- Check your internet connection
- Verify Twitch credentials are correct
