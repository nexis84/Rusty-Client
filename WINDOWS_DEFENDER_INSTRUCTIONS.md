# üõ°Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Windows Defender Instructions

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Before You Extract!

**Windows Defender will block this application as a false positive.**

This is normal for compiled Python applications. RustyBot is 100% safe and open source.

### üìã Setup Steps (FOLLOW IN ORDER!)

#### **Step 1: Download the ZIP**
- Download `RustyBot_v1.3.9_Standalone.zip`
- **DO NOT extract yet!**

#### **Step 2: Create Installation Folder**
- Create a folder where you want RustyBot (e.g., `C:\RustyBot` or `D:\Games\RustyBot`)
- Remember this location!

#### **Step 3: Add Windows Defender Exclusion**

**Before extracting**, add an exclusion to Windows Defender:

1. Open **Windows Security** (search in Start menu)
2. Click **"Virus & threat protection"**
3. Under "Virus & threat protection settings", click **"Manage settings"**
4. Scroll down to **"Exclusions"**
5. Click **"Add or remove exclusions"**
6. Click **"Add an exclusion"** ‚Üí Select **"Folder"**
7. Browse to the folder you created in Step 2
8. Click **"Select Folder"**

‚úÖ You should see your folder listed in exclusions

#### **Step 4: Extract the ZIP**
- Right-click `RustyBot_v1.3.9_Standalone.zip`
- Select **"Extract All..."**
- Extract to the folder you created in Step 2
- Click **"Extract"**

#### **Step 5: Run RustyBot**
- Open the extracted folder
- Double-click **`RustyBot.vbs`** (recommended) or **`RustyBot.bat`**
- First time: Enter your Twitch channel name
- Enjoy! üéâ

## ü§î Why Windows Defender Blocks This

RustyBot is compiled from Python using Nuitka. This is a legitimate tool that:
- Converts Python code to executable files
- Makes the program faster and easier to distribute
- Unfortunately, triggers false positives in antivirus software

**This is completely normal and safe!**

- ‚úÖ Open source: https://github.com/nexis84/Rusty-Client
- ‚úÖ No malicious code
- ‚úÖ Used by many Python developers
- ‚úÖ You can review the source code yourself

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "Windows Defender deleted my files during extraction"
- You didn't add the exclusion before extracting
- Delete the partially extracted folder
- Follow Step 3 above to add exclusion
- Extract again

### "Can't add exclusion - Access Denied"
- You need Administrator rights on your PC
- Right-click Windows Security ‚Üí Run as Administrator
- Try adding the exclusion again

### "Still getting blocked even with exclusion"
- Make sure you added the exclusion to the **folder**, not the ZIP file
- The exclusion must match the extraction path exactly
- Try restarting your computer after adding the exclusion

### "RustyBot.vbs does nothing when I double-click"
- The exe was quarantined by Windows Defender
- Check Windows Security ‚Üí Protection history
- Restore `RustyBot.exe` if quarantined
- Make sure the exclusion is properly added
