========================================
  EASY INSTALLATION (RECOMMENDED)
========================================

**Option 1: GUI Installer (Easiest!)**

1. Extract this ZIP anywhere (e.g., Downloads folder)

2. Right-click "Run_Installer.bat" → "Run as Administrator"
   - This adds Windows Defender exclusion for the installer
   - Then launches the beautiful GUI installer
   - Follow the step-by-step wizard

   OR if you prefer:
   - Double-click "Run_Installer.bat" (will prompt for admin rights)

**Option 2: Script Installer**

1. Extract this ZIP anywhere (e.g., Downloads folder)

2. Double-click "Install.bat"
   - It will automatically:
     ✓ Ask where to install RustyBot
     ✓ Add Windows Defender exclusion (prevents blocking)
     ✓ Copy all files
     ✓ Create desktop shortcut
     ✓ Launch RustyBot

3. Done! Use the desktop shortcut to run RustyBot

========================================
  MANUAL INSTALLATION (Advanced)
========================================

If you prefer manual installation:

1. Create a folder where you want RustyBot (e.g., C:\RustyBot)

2. Add Windows Defender Exclusion FIRST:
   - Open Windows Security
   - Virus & threat protection → Manage settings
   - Exclusions → Add or remove exclusions
   - Add exclusion → Folder
   - Select the folder you created in step 1

3. Extract this ZIP to that folder

4. Run RustyBot.vbs

========================================
  WHY WINDOWS DEFENDER BLOCKS THIS
========================================

RustyBot is compiled Python using Nuitka - a legitimate tool
that unfortunately triggers false positives.
