# Asset Path Migration - RustyBot v1.38

**Date:** October 1, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## Overview
Reorganized project structure by moving HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files into a dedicated `assets/` folder for better organization and maintainability.

## Changes Made

### 1. File Movements ✅
All web assets moved from root to `assets/` folder:
- `animation.html` → `assets/animation.html`
- `mini_test.html` → `assets/mini_test.html`
- `portrait_test.html` → `assets/portrait_test.html`
- `script.js` → `assets/script.js`
- `background_lists.js` → `assets/background_lists.js`
- `network_animation.js` → `assets/network_animation.js`
- `qwebchannel.js` → `assets/qwebchannel.js`
- `style.css` → `assets/style.css`

### 2. Code Updates ✅

#### animation_manager.py
Updated file path constants to reference `assets/` folder:
```python
# OLD
ANIMATION_HTML_FILE = "animation.html"
ANIMATION_JS_FILE = "script.js"
# ... etc

# NEW
ANIMATION_HTML_FILE = "assets/animation.html"
ANIMATION_JS_FILE = "assets/script.js"
# ... etc
```

#### specs/RustyBot_Main.spec
Updated PyInstaller data collection to package assets from correct location:
```python
# OLD
datas=[
    ('animation.html', '.'),
    ('script.js', '.'),
    # ...
]

# NEW
datas=[
    ('assets/animation.html', 'assets'),
    ('assets/script.js', 'assets'),
    # ...
]
```

Also removed backup sound files (`.bk` files) from the spec since they're now in `backup/` folder.

### 3. Files That Stayed in Root
These files remain in the root directory:
- `loading_init.png` - Loading screen image
- `Loading.png` - Alternate loading image
- `RUSTY BOT.png` - Application logo
- `icon.ico` - Application icon

## Testing Checklist

Before running the application, verify:

- [ ] All asset files exist in `assets/` folder
- [ ] PyInstaller spec file updated (if building executable)
- [ ] Application starts without file not found errors
- [ ] Animation system loads correctly
- [ ] WebEngine displays winner animations

## Rollback Instructions

If issues occur, revert by:
1. Move files from `assets/` back to root
2. Restore original paths in `animation_manager.py`
3. Restore original `specs/RustyBot_Main.spec`

## Benefits

✅ **Better organization** - Clear separation of web assets  
✅ **Easier maintenance** - Assets grouped logically  
✅ **Cleaner root** - Less clutter in main directory  
✅ **Scalability** - Easy to add more assets in the future

## Notes

- The `resource_path()` function in `animation_manager.py` handles both development and PyInstaller packaged environments
- All paths use forward slashes for cross-platform compatibility
- No changes needed to HTML/JS files themselves - only Python references updated

## Version Compatibility

- **Works with:** RustyBot v1.38+
- **Breaking change:** Older versions will need manual path updates
- **PyInstaller:** Requires updated spec file for building executables

---

**Migration completed successfully!** All asset paths now reference the organized `assets/` folder structure.
