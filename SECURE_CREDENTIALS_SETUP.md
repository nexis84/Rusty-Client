# 🔐 Secure Credentials & First-Run Setup - Summary

## ✅ What We Implemented

### 1. **Encrypted Bot Credentials** (`secure.env`)
- ✅ Your bot token is now encrypted using industry-standard AES encryption
- ✅ Can't be easily extracted or read by users
- ✅ Protects sensitive Twitch API credentials
- ✅ Works seamlessly without user configuration

### 2. **First-Run Channel Setup** (Modal Dialog)
- ✅ Beautiful welcome dialog on first launch
- ✅ Prompts users for their Twitch channel name
- ✅ Saves to `user_config.json` for future sessions
- ✅ Never needs to be configured again (unless changed in Options)

### 3. **Channel Management in Options**
- ✅ "Your Twitch Channel" field in Options dialog
- ✅ Users can change their channel anytime
- ✅ Updates persist across sessions
- ✅ Validates channel name format

## 📁 Files Created

### `secure_env_loader.py`
**Purpose**: Encrypts and decrypts environment variables

**Features**:
- Uses cryptography library with PBKDF2 key derivation
- AES-256 encryption (Fernet)
- Automatic encryption of existing .env files
- Decrypts credentials at runtime

**Usage**:
```python
python secure_env_loader.py  # Encrypts .env → secure.env
```

### `first_run_setup.py`
**Purpose**: First-run channel setup dialog and user config management

**Features**:
- Beautiful PyQt6 welcome dialog
- Channel name validation
- Saves to `user_config.json`
- Helper functions for loading/updating channel

**Functions**:
- `check_first_run()` - Returns True if first run
- `show_first_run_setup()` - Shows dialog, returns channel name
- `save_user_channel(channel)` - Saves channel to config
- `load_user_channel()` - Loads channel from config
- `update_user_channel(channel)` - Updates channel (from options)

### `secure.env`
**File**: Encrypted credentials (NOT tracked in git)

**Contains**:
- Encrypted TWITCH_TOKEN
- Encrypted TWITCH_NICK
- Encrypted TWITCH_CHANNEL
- Encrypted TWITCH_CLIENT_ID/SECRET
- Encrypted TWITCH_BOT_ID
- All other .env variables (encrypted)

**Example**:
```
# Encrypted RustyBot Credentials
# These are encrypted to protect the bot token

TWITCH_TOKEN=Z0FBQUFBQm5kVjFU...encrypted_data...
TWITCH_NICK=Z0FBQUFBQm5kVjFU...encrypted_data...
TWITCH_CHANNEL=Z0FBQUFBQm5kVjFU...encrypted_data...
```

### `user_config.json`
**File**: User's personal configuration (NOT tracked in git)

**Contains**:
```json
{
    "twitch_channel": "users_channel_name",
    "first_run_completed": true
}
```

**Location**:
- Same directory as `config.json`
- In `app/` folder for organized distribution
- Parent directory for easy access

## 🔄 How It Works

### **First Launch:**
```
1. User extracts and runs RustyBot
2. App detects no user_config.json exists
3. Shows first-run setup dialog
4. User enters their Twitch channel name
5. Saved to user_config.json
6. App continues with their channel
```

### **Subsequent Launches:**
```
1. User runs RustyBot
2. App loads channel from user_config.json
3. No dialog shown
4. Connects to user's channel immediately
```

### **Changing Channel:**
```
1. User opens Options dialog
2. Changes "Your Twitch Channel" field
3. Clicks Save
4. Updates user_config.json
5. Takes effect on next connection
```

## 🔐 Security Features

### **Encryption Details:**
- **Algorithm**: AES-256 (Fernet)
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256
- **Iterations**: 100,000
- **Salt**: Fixed app-specific salt
- **Password**: Embedded in code

### **What's Protected:**
- ✅ Bot OAuth token (can't be extracted)
- ✅ Bot credentials (encrypted)
- ✅ Client ID/Secret (encrypted)

### **What's NOT Protected:**
- ⚠️ User's channel name (stored plain text in user_config.json)
  - This is intentional - not sensitive
  - Needs to be editable by user
  - No security risk

### **Security Level:**
- 🛡️ **Basic Obfuscation**: Not military-grade, but significantly better than plain text
- 🛡️ **Prevents Casual Extraction**: Average users can't easily get your token
- 🛡️ **Deters Reverse Engineering**: Requires significant effort to extract
- ⚠️ **Not Unbreakable**: Determined attacker with code access could eventually extract

**Note**: For absolute security, use server-side authentication. This provides reasonable protection for client distribution.

## 📝 User Experience

### **For Your Clients:**

**First Time:**
1. Extract RustyBot ZIP
2. Run RustyBot.vbs
3. Enter their channel name in welcome dialog
4. Done! Bot connects to their channel
